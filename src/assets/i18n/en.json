    "HOME_PAGE.p1": "Hi, I'm Miu Asakura on Louisoix. I'm the creator of FFXIV Teamcraft, a tool that allows you to create crafting lists online, share them with your friend and contribute together in realtime. Because we were struggling to manage big lists using actual tools, I wanted to have a way to create lists that are stored, on which every could say \"I have that, I can provide it\". So I started creating FFXIV Teamcraft.",
    "HOME_PAGE.p2": "Then I thought \"If my FC finds the app useful, why would others not find it useful too?\". So I bought a domain name, I made a reddit topic and started adding more features. At the moment the app is able to store your crafting lists, show you what you can gather/craft by yourself, all of this in your language (some translated assets are still missing but they will be available in the future) with a single link. Wether you are French, English or Deutch speaker, the app will show you a version of the list that you can understand. That's the main goal of the application.",
