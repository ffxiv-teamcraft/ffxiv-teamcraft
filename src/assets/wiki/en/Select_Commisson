## Steps
1. Open the Commission board
2. Choose a List.
3. You can contact the author of the request to work out the details. When ready, Apply for this commission.
4. Once hired, the request goes into the My ongoing commissions tab.
5. Open the list, and mark off the items as you finish. This keeps the client up to date on the progress.
6. After the items are delivered, and payment has been made, the client will archive the list. When the list is archived, both the you and the crafter will have the opportunity to rate each other.
   > PLEASE NOTE, THIS IS A SERIOUS RATING. BASE YOUR RATINGS ON ONLY THE COMMISSION EXPERIENCE - ITEMS DELIVERED ON TIME, IN THE AGREED UPON MANNER. 
7. Congrats, you're done!
