# Contributing

First of all, come on [Discord] and poke @Miu to tell him that you would like to contribute to the wiki, with the language you want to contribute on.

## References

 * [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
 * [Github repository].
 * [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), in-browser markdown editor.
 * [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html), cross-OS markdown editor.

## Guidelines

 * Links to internal urls (teamcraft pages) have to be relative from teamcraft's url in order to ensure the navigation is handled properly.
    * Example: `https://ffxivteamcraft.com/lists` has to be linked as `/lists`.
 * Titles from 1 (`#`) to 3 (`###`) will be shown in the table of contents in right part of the screen.

## With github

 1. Create your file in `src/assets/<language code>/`.
    * The file has to be named in english, and has to end with `.md`
 2. Write your content inside the file.
 3. Commit your work with a message following this format: `docs: added wiki page for ...`
 4. Create a Pull Request once you have added everything you wanted to add.

## Without github

 1. Create a file using one of the editors linked above.
 2. Send me the file on discord.
 
## Credits

You can (and probably should) add credits to your wiki page by following this format:

```

`Written by: Your Name`
```

This message has to be placed at the bottom of the document.
