### Commit Messages
 The commit messages are checked by a pre-commit git hook, meaning that if they don't meet the requirements, 
 your commit will not be created.
 
 A commit message should follow this structure:
 ```
    <type>: <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>
 ```
 
 Only the first line is mandatory, the rest is optional.
 
 Types are the ones used by [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version):
 
 - **feat** - New feature
 - **fix** - Bug fix
 - **docs** - Documentation-related
 - **style** - Style-related
 - **refactor** - Refactoring of a code piece/feature
 - **perf** - Performance optimization
 - **test** - Tests-related
